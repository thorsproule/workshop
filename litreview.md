## Determining the Movement Patterns of Different Populations Following Natural Disasters Events in the Caribbean

#### By Thor Sproule

##### **Introduction**

The purpose of this research is to determine how different economic and social groups throughout the Caribbean move in response to natural disasters. Determining a target group's demographic will allow for us to see how various factors play a part in the migration habits of the Caribbean people. We will see how things like a person’s economic status, age, or gender, affects their migration following a natural disaster. By using Twitter and cell phone data to predict and track movement, patterns can be found so that aid can be distributed better and in a more timely fashion. Currently, tracking data is limited to specified groups but the entire population is more difficult to track using a singular approach.

**Human Development Topic**

The positions and geologic factors of the island nations that form the Caribbean make many of these small countries prone to natural disasters. Disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes happen almost yearly and Caribbean countries have to adapt and recover from these events. Following these kinds of natural disasters, people from the Caribbean migrate to safer and more secure locations, mainly the United States or mainland Central America while clean- up efforts begin in their home country. The migration of this populace differs due to factors about the population such as age, gender, or economic status. For my research I looked to see how these factors have affected the migration of the population. Once we have discovered the factors affecting migratory actions, the Caribbean can develop further as it becomes better suited in helping its citizens and locating them post- disaster. Relief efforts and aid can then be sent to locations where people need the most help and support. Amartya Sen says that in order for development to occur, unfreedoms must be removed. These unfreedoms include fear of natural disasters and fear for their family and friends. By utilizing safe migratory actions as well as being able to accurately locate family and friends following a natural disaster provides a sense of security. 

**Methods and Data**

Throughout the papers, the authors use different datasets in the context of the Caribbean. The main dataset comes from tweets and other types of Twitter data that are very helpful in understanding the migration and movement patterns of various Caribbean people. By using certain keywords, such as “hurricane”, Twitter data can also be used to see how many tweets there are pertaining to hurricanes or other events (Vayansky, 2018). This allows for us to see how many people are tweeting about these disasters so a scale can be set. Twitter data was used in Puerto Rico following 2017’s Hurricane Maria in order to track and locate the Puerto Rican population who had fled the storm. Pre-disaster data was used to determine where Puerto Rican Twitter users were in Puerto Rico as well as where they traveled to in the rest of the world. In order to decide which tweets came from Puerto Rican people as opposed to non- Puerto Rican residents, the median location of any accounts that tweeted from Puerto Rico was identified and Puerto Rican residents were determined to have their median location within Puerto Rico. Twitter accounts that were non- human, had multiple owners, or were inactive for a month following the hurricane were removed for increased accuracy. The location of tweets from the remaining accounts was then used to discover how this population moved post- hurricane (Martin, 2020). The demographics of all the users were also taken into account. Profile information was used to determine whether the user was male or female as well as to sort the user into a specific age range. This data was combined with which region of Puerto Rico the user was estimated to live in order to ascertain the displacement of these people. It was found that males made up more of the Twitter population with 55% of the accounts being male. The male population declined in Twitter usage as age increased, however, there was still a considerable amount of male usage up until the mid 40s in age. The female population on the other hand had the majority of its data coming from the 15 to 24 years old age range. From 25 years old and onwards, the usage of female accounts severely dropped off in number. Along with this age data, travel data was also needed. Only around 36% of the Twitter users migrated away from Puerto Rico in the weeks following Hurricane Maria. Much of the displaced population returned once infrastructure like power and water lines had been restored (Martin, 2020). Using these datasets we can infer that using Twitter data is more suited in tracking a younger populace. For a complete understanding of this migratory data, we would need older people to equally use Twitter so that the data is more constant. However, it would be difficult to get older people involved technologically. We can also see that, unless their home was destroyed, people tended to stay in Puerto Rico while the ones who left came back once infrastructure was fixed. So in order for a more complete picture of this migration, we would also need a complementary dataset that could better target older peoples’ movements following disasters since they are less adept at technology usage. 

Following natural disasters, many Caribbean countries are in need of humanitarian and relief efforts to help clean up as well as provide things like first aid. In order for aid to be distributed correctly, the population needs to be accounted for and located. After the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, cell phone data was used in order to track the movements of the citizens and better allocate resources. The population of Haiti’s capital, Port-au-Prince, was the main area of exploration as it was more affected by the earthquake and had a large number of people to gather data from. The location of where calls were made following the earthquake were used to determine the movements of people. Along with the data following the earthquake, call locations from before the disaster were used to show a person’s home area. Originally, the migration of the population was predicted to have a low level of predictability due to the amount of disorder after the disaster. However, the results showed a more predictable pattern as people were shown to migrate to areas they had been to before (Lu, 2012). These datasets make logical sense as displaced people would more than likely go stay with family and friends that they have visited before. This data also suggests that relief efforts can be improved upon since locations can be discovered and movements are not as chaotic as they appear to be. In order to gain even more of a complete picture through this data, the total number of days with data collected prior to the earthquake should be lengthened so that people’s original movements can be even clearer. The damages and after- effects of natural disasters lead people to migrate out of their country due to safety concerns as well as possible financial misfortunes. Due to these disasters, many Caribbean persons migrate to countries with infrastructural and financial stability like the United States. Throughout the Caribbean, there is a trend of having migratory movement following storms that caused devastation. In Anguilla, the Bahamas, as well as Costa Rica, there has been a pattern of increased migration to the United States following a severe storm in that country. However, in some countries this was not the case as this trend seemed to be affected by multiple storms. Even so, the mean of immigrants to the United States was much higher in years following disasters than it was in years not following a disaster (Afonso, 2011). With this data we can see that, in general, migration rates rise following a natural disaster. Even so, these migration rates can be affected by the variation of several different factors. The GDP of a country, its population, as well as its proximity to the United States play a factor in changing the migration counts (Afonso, 2011). Countries with a low GDP per capita have more of its population migrate, especially following disasters. This could mean that people migrate because they see the disasters as a pushing factor and use the disaster as an opportunity to move to somewhere like the United States and improve their economic and financial statuses. Caribbean countries with high population counts are also more likely to have increased migration. This makes intuitive sense as the more people a country has, the more people can migrate from it. Countries closer to the United States also have increased rates because it is easier for them to move shorter distances. Due to the fact that much of the displaced population from disasters in the Caribbean tend to migrate to areas with family and friends, finding out where there are concentrations of Caribbean people in the United States can be used to better locate dispersed populations. By using census data we can see that the majority of immigrants from the Caribbean who were already living in the United States have a large presence in metropolitan areas like Miami and New York (Zong, 2019). This data of Caribbean immigrants going to these places coincides with Twitter data from Martin et al. which showed that places in Florida and New York received more activity from Puerto Rican accounts following the hurricane there. All this data allows us to see that there is an increased amount of migration following disasters and that there are other factors to consider, like GDP and population, which contribute to the movement of Caribbean people. 

Throughout the entirety of the Caribbean, there has been a rapid increase in population growth over the past half century. Due to this growth there has been a movement of internal migration in Caribbean countries to areas that are at a higher risk of natural disasters. Since there is a large amount of possible economic gain from things like tourism, fishing, or trade, many people have started moving towards coastal areas. Increasing the population density of these coastal areas will lead to more people being affected by natural disasters (Charveriat, 2000). Many of these people are migrating to try to find a more profitable lifestyle on the coast, but this movement is putting them more at risk of potential disasters. Flooding is especially devastating to the large, low lying cities many of these people are migrating to (Fontes de Meira, 2019). This internal migration is subsequently hurting the population which is only trying to improve upon its own quality of life.

**Discussion**

After researching I have found that in using cell phone and Twitter data, there is an underlying bias towards a younger populace. While there still is a considerable amount of older people using apps like Twitter, younger people will skew the data towards a younger person’s status. There also was also a slight unbalance in the Twitter data as more male Twitter users were a part of the sample. These types of disturbances in the data do not truly show the actual representation but skew the data one way or the other. It is also still difficult to track the population using a singular method. In order to gain the most data, multiple approaches must be used to gather all the needed data. I believe that in conjunction with things like cell phone and Twitter data, there should also be something more representative of the older population. I also believe that I will continue to use the effects of natural disasters on the Caribbean as a whole and not narrow it down to data from one specific type of disaster like earthquake or hurricane. So far I believe that the gap in my research addresses the fact that older people are less adept at using technology and how could we reasonably collect their cell phone data when they utilize it less. I believe that my central research question will ask how do different demographics move in response to natural disasters and how can we continue to gather migration data from demographics that do not consistently use their cell phones.
