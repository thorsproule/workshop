Nieves uses the random forest method to see different types of landscapes and predict the global population distribution and where people live. Random forest works by using its data to create decision trees which branch off after using the data to answer questions. Random forest combines all the ‘weak’ trees and combines them into ‘stronger’ learning trees. The trees keep branching out until all the questions have been accounted for. The random forest also keeps about a third of the data left out of the calculations which is called ‘out of bag’ data. This ‘out of bag’ data is then used to compare to the data obtained from the trees. Dasymetric population allocation occurs when the trees have been branched out and census data is applied to the results. The population data is allocated among the different grid cells and counties which combine to the total census data. Geospatial covariates are also used in producing the data of where populations live. The most important covariates in the random forest are urban areas as well as environmental covariates. Urban areas are important because they show where a majority of people actually live. Environmental covariates are important because studies show people tend to live in proximity to water and low lying coastal areas.
