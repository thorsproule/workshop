# Response to Jahan and Rosling

In his speach Jahan states that there are several issues that are in need of attention throughout the world. One of such issues is that levels of work must be created in order for human development to expand. He also states that youth employment, gender work, agriculture, and the informal sector must be a priority. Things like care work and artists also play a role that needs to be focused on. At the beginning of his talk Jahan also gives his definition of what human development is. He says that human development is that of enlarging human choices. Jahan gives two steps to enlarge human choices. The first is that human capabilities must be enhanced in order for people to have more choices. The second is that there must be opportunities that are created in order for people to show off their capabilities. Jahan also speaks on the Human Development Index and the measures it takes.
