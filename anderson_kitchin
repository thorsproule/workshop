Anderson's description of the "death of theory" means that he believes that by use of big data, scientific theories will eventually become obsolete. He says that since there is so much data coming in, the scientific method and its parts like testing and experiments will eventually not be needed anymore because there will already be so much data collected from systems that can be used in place of experimenting. However, Kitchin argues that big data has its flaws too and should not just be used in place of testing. He says that with such a large sample set of data, bias and interpretation will be used which would end up flawing the data that is uncovered.
I believe that theory will eventually be killed off by big data as large datasets are used to better predict the future using probabilities to solve problems. Using big data also allows for companies to gain maximum information at a cheaper price than having to go out and spend money sampling populations. Big data can be generated continually so there will always be new information being presented for companies to use. Having such a large dataset lets researchers explore data and expand their research by using a large sample. I also believe that we are entering a new paradigm because as a whole, we are focused on predicting the future where as past generations were more focused on why things worked and gaining a further explanation of things.
